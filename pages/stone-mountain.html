      Stone Mountain: Stone Mountain Park is Georgiaâ€™s #1 tourist site and is a
      quartz monzonite dome monadnock as well as the largest piece of exposed
      granite in the world. The area is well known for not only its geology, but
      also the enormous rock relied on its north face, the largest bas relief in
      the world. Stone Mountain today consists of a nature park and community
      that shares the same name. Today, the park is surrounded in controversy as
      there have been calls for the removal of the large stone sculpture,
      completed in 1972, that shows three Confederate Generals from the Civil
      War.
