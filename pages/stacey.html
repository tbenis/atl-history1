      Stacy Abrams: is an American politician, lawyer, voting rights activist.
      After witnessing the gross mismanagement of the 2018 election by the
      Secretary of Stateâ€™s office, Abrams launched multiple organizations to
      ensure every American has a voice in our election system. Fair Fight, Fair
      Count are just two of the many groups created under Abrams vision that are
      devoted to voter rights, training and hiring young people of color,
      tackling social issues at both the state and national levels.
