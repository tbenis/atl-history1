    <p>
      MLK House: Located at 501 Auburn Avenue, The King Birth Home was the
      family home of the King family until 1941 and is where King Jr. was born
      in 1929. The home sits about a block east of Ebenezer Baptist Church,
      where King Jr’s maternal grandfather was a pastor. After King Jr.’s
      assassination in 1968, the home was turned into a museum with special
      events and programs dedicated to the Civil Rights Movement.
