      Center for Civil & Human Rights: The National Center for Civil and Human
      rights opened in 2014 and is a museum and human rights organization in
      Atlanta that inspired people to tap into their own power to change the
      world around them. The Centerâ€™s iconic exhibitions feature papers and
      artifacts of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the history of the US civil
      rights movement and stories from the struggle for human rights around the
      world today. The center hosts performances, book talks, lectures and
      conversations and brings history alive for students of all ages.
