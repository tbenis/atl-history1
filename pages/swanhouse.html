      Swan House: Designed by noted architect Philip Trammel Shutze, and
      completed in 1928, the Swan House, located in the Buckhead suburb of
      Atlanta. In 1967 the house opened as a museum and headquarters of the
      Atlanta Historical Society and features a glimpse into the past with the
      collection of historical decor and artifacts. Due to discriminatory Jim
      Crow legislation which was designed to create barriers to education,
      politics and employment, many household staff members were African
      American men and women. In 1933, Elizabeth “Lizzie” McDuffie, left the
      Swan House to work in the President Franklin D Roosevelt While House.
      There she advocated for racial equality, was a political activist and
      helped form a worker’s union for government employees.
