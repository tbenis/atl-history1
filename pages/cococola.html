      Coca Cola Museum: Founded in Atlanta in 1892, The Coca-Cola Museum is
      located at 121 Baker Street at the Coca Cola Headquarters. The original
      recipe was developed by John Stith Pemberton from Columbus, GA, as a
      medicinal beverage. In 1889, Asa Griggs Candler purchased the formula and
      by 1895 the drink was being sold in every state. Today the museum offers
      tours, event space and many other activities.
